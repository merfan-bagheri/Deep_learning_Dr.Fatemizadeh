    "### **Description:**\n",
    "- In this phase, the system detects objects in video frames or images using a **pre-trained object detection model**.\n",
    "- Each detected object is assigned a **bounding box**, along with a **class label and confidence score**.\n",
    "- The detection phase serves as an input for the tracking stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Outputs:**\n",
    "- Bounding boxes around detected objects.\n",
    "- Class labels and confidence scores displayed on the screen.\n",
    "- Frames with visualized detection results.\n",

    "### **Description:**\n",
    "- After detection, a **single object** is selected and tracked across frames using a **Single Object Tracking (SOT) algorithm**.\n",
    "- The selected object is continuously tracked using a bounding box, which updates dynamically.\n",
    "- Algorithms like **CSRT, KCF, and Siamese Networks** are commonly used in this phase.\n",

    "### **Expected Outputs:**\n",
    "- A **single bounding box** around the selected object that updates across frames.\n",

    "- Each tracked object is assigned a **unique ID**, which remains consistent throughout the video.\n",
    "\n",
